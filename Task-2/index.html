            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Anuradha Koirala found the seeds of service early in her childhood from her family, who believed in helping others. Her grandfather would often tell her: you may eat one meal less, but do not let the needy go hungry. Today, Anuradha Koirala has become a household name in Nepal for her efforts in rescuing and rehabilitating women. Lovingly called Dijju, meaning elder sister in Nepali, Anuradha Koirala was born on April 14, 1949, to Colonel Pratap Singh Gurung and Laxmi Gurung. She received her education at St. Joseph Convent , a hill station in Kalimpong, India. The Mother and Sisters of her school further deepened her devotion towards service and social work. Watching Mother Teresa’s work when she was studying in Calcutta influenced and inspired her greatly. Her father’s dream of making her a lawyer and her dream to become an air hostess took a backseat as the desire to serve flourished.</p>
